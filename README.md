# XLIFF Importer

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xlf_importer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xlf_importer) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diasks2/xlf_importer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/diasks2/xlf_importer) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/diasks2/xlf_importer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

This gem handles the importing and parsing of [.xlf files](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/xliff-core.html). [XLIFF files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) are xml files.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

**Ruby**  
```
gem install xlf_importer
```

**Ruby on Rails**  
Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:  
```ruby 
gem 'xlf_importer'
```

## Usage

```ruby
# Get the high level stats of an XLIFF file
# Including the encoding is optional. If not included the gem will attempt to detect the encoding.
file_path = File.expand_path('../xlf_importer/spec/test_sample_files/sample_alt_translation.xlf')
XlfImporter::Xlf.new(file_path: file_path).stats
# => {:tu_count=>1, :seg_count=>3, :language_pairs=>[["en", "fr"], ["en", "es"]]}

# Extract the segments of an XLIFF file
# Result: [translation_units, segments]
# translation_units = [tu_id]
# segments = [tu_id, segment_role, word_count, language, segment_text]

XlfImporter::Xlf.new(file_path: file_path).import
# => [[["6234-1457917153-1"]], [["6234-1457917153-1", "source", 2, "en", "Hello world"], ["6234-1457917153-1", "target", 3, "fr", "Bonjour le monde"], ["6234-1457917153-1", "target", 2, "es", "Hola mundo"]]]
